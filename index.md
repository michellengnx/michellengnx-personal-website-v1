## About Me

Michelle is an aspiring developer who is passionate about finding creative solutions for real-life applications. As a life-long learner, she often finds herself seeking out every opportunities to acquire new skills and learn from other people. Aside from her studies at Seneca College, she also works as volunteer developer at Vietnamese Student Association at Seneca College.  She is actively searching for internship opportunities in the Fall of 2021. 

Well, that's enough about myself from a third person.

## Who Am I?
---

Hey! This is Michelle - the owner of this website. Welcome to my virtual home!
My philosophy is, there's always something that I've yet to learn, people that I've yet to meet, and a better me that I've yet to become :). 
That being said, I created this website to showcase my work and to reflect on my journey as an developer. 
Outside of work, I read, I run or sometimes (or a lot of times) I just let myself get lost in a new Toronto neighbour that I've just discovered.
