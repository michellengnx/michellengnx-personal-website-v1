## Who Am I?
---

Hello World! This is Michelle - the owner of this website. Welcome to my virtual home!
My philosophy is, there's always something that I've yet to learn, people that I've yet to meet, and a better me that I've yet to become :). 
That being said, I created this website to showcase my work and to reflect on my journey as an developer. Outside of work, I enjoy rock-climbing, paddling,  reading and hanging out with friends.
